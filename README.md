The bicycle sales company wants to determine the purchasing patterns of different demographic groups to identify areas where it needs to concentrate its marketing efforts. The company also wants to see if there are purchasing differences between the countries where it operates.  
# Bike Sales Data Analysis Project

This project involves the analysis of a **Bike Sales** dataset using **Microsoft Excel**. The objective of this analysis was to gain insights into bike sales by exploring key dimensions such as **Year**, **Age Group**, **Customer Gender**, **Country**, and **Order Quantity**. I created **Pivot Tables** and **Pivot Charts** to summarize and visualize the data effectively, along with adding custom columns for **Commission** and **Total Sales**.

## Project Overview

The analysis is based on a dataset that contains detailed information about bike sales transactions. To provide meaningful insights, I used **Pivot Tables** to summarize the data and **Pivot Charts** to visualize trends and comparisons. I focused on several key variables:
- **Year**
- **Age Group**
- **Customer Gender**
- **Country**
- **Order Quantity**

Additionally, some columns, such as **Customer Age**, **State**, **Product Category**, **Sub-Category**, and **Product**, were hidden to focus the analysis on the most relevant information for understanding sales patterns.

### Key Features of the Analysis:
- **Pivot Tables**: Used to summarize sales data by grouping it by **Age Group** and **Country**, and calculating the **sum of order quantity**.
- **Pivot Charts**: Created charts to visualize the sales data trends and comparisons across different age groups and countries.
- **Commission & Total Sales**: Added new columns to calculate commission and total sales based on unit prices and order quantities.

## Tools Used:
- **Microsoft Excel**
  - **Pivot Table**: For summarizing data and creating grouped views.
  - **Pivot Chart**: For visualizing the summarized data and spotting trends.
  - **Excel Formulas**: To calculate commissions and total sales using formulas.

## Analysis Breakdown

### Steps Involved:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Removed irrelevant columns such as Customer Age, State, Product Category, Sub-Category, and Product to focus the analysis.
2. **Creating Pivot Table**: 
   - Grouped data by **Country** and **Age Group**.
   - Summed the **Order Quantity** for each **Age Group** and each **Country**.
3. **Creating Pivot Chart**: Added charts based on the Pivot Table to visualize the sales trends.
4. **Adding Commission & Total Sales**: Used Excel formulas to calculate commission based on sales volume and total sales for each transaction.
   
### Pivot Table Details:
- The **Pivot Table** was designed to display each **Country** grouped under each **Age Group**, with the **sum of the order quantity** for each age group displayed in total.
- The total sales for each **Country** under a given **Age Group** were also displayed.

### Visualizations:
Pivot Charts were created to help visualize:
- Trends in **Order Quantity** over the years.
- Comparisons between different **Age Groups** and **Countries**.
